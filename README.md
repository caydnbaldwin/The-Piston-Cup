# The-Piston-Cup
A VBA program that shows a randomly generated race between Lightning McQueen, Chick Hicks, and The King.

## Instructions
Sub `Start` initiates the race. A random number is generated between 1 and 3. The number pertains to the lane of each racer and will increment their distance traveled by 1 cell. First racer across the line wins and a congratulatory message is printed. Checks are in place to ensure that no racer gets too far ahead. This is done by checking if the distance between first and last place is greater than or equal to 3.

## Applications
This program is an example of a short video game to watch.
